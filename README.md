# Hello-World

Hello world, this is my first repository but surely not my last.

My name is Jeff, I am a 24 year-old living out of Orlando, Florida.  Within this past week I have decided to make a career change and start teaching myself to learn a few basic coding languages in hopes of being able to get a Junior Developer job somewhere at least within a year.  If you have any advice or pointers please DO NOT hesitate to help a brother out.
